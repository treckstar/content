## Teaching

Everyone has to start somewhere, and one thing I have always enjoyed was being able to help. The internet is filled with authentic tutorials, guides, eBooks, and sources for new up & coming developers. However, it is challenging to find the correct material if you don't know what to look for. I can provide resources that are best-practice for the DIY folk, and training for those who learn better with hands-on demonstrations.

__Note:__ I provide both in-person and online training, please contact me for more information.

## Front-end Web Development

My experience with professional front-end development begins in 2012. However I have been doing development since Yahoo! Geocities existed. Before responsive ideaologies existed, it was standard to create web layouts using `<table>` elements, where each `<tr>` typically represented a region. Browser compatibility and quality assurance have always been apart of the process, and have battled through the IE 7-10 conditional comments and polyfills.
