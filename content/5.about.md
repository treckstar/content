## About me

With over a decade of professional experience, I am deeply committed to open source technology. This team spirit is at the core of my development philosophy.

I frequently collaborate on repositories and push succinct, incremental commits. Typically, a pull request is easier to manage with small commits versus one massive commit.

I use macOS, Windows, and Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch). I spend a lot of time tweaking my local environment with dotfile configurations. I mainly switch between vim and VSCode for my IDE. 

Lastly I am a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, specifically the split ergonomic types. I have been slowly getting better with my Glove80; however I really would like to build my own Dactyl someday.

I believe there are no dumb questions, and welcome newer developers or anyone willing to ask.  If I don't know the answer, then I will gladly make the effort to find out.
