## Emergency

So you picked Strapi, the greatest headless CMS, for your latest project? Let me guess, you needed to update your content model and suddenly, you're missing some tables? Maybe even all your content is gone? 

The backup from the last 2 weeks are corrupt and you have to use the one from soft launch? Maybe you don't even have a backup? How could this happen, what kind of sick joke of a CMS is this?

To be continued, check back soon!
