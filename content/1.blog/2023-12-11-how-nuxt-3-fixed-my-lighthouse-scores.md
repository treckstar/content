## Vercel

I have recently been refreshing my blog, and SEO and page speed are very important to me. Using Vercel Analytics, I was able to see the performance improvements in real-time. The first image below shows the performance of my website before the update. The second image shows the performance after the update.

## Lighthouse Scores

Iniitially my Lighthouse scores were not great. I was getting a score of 50-60 for performance. After the update, my scores improved to 90-100. 

Simply switching from `nuxt build` to `nuxt generate` made a huge difference.
